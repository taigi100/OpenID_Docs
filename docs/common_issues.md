## Facebook

#### Request not returning email address
For Facebook, the email address will only be returned if it is confirmed and set as the primary email. By default, test users do not have their email address set as primary, so to retrieve the email address, you will need to login as the test user through the Facebook dashboard.
Once logged in, navigate to the Settings > Contact and set the email as primary. This will ensure that the email address is returned when the plugin is used.
