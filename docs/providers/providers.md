The plugin is intended to work with any OAuth2 or OpenID provider. It currently only supports some flows and is not complete.

For the following providers the plugin is tested (and their status):

| Provider        | OAuth2          | OpenID |
|-------------|------------------|------|
| [Google](./google) |  &#9989; | &#9989;  |
| [Facebook](./facebook) |  &#9989;   | &#10060;  |

If you use a different provider of have a special use-case, please contact me and let me know!
